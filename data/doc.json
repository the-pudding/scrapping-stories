So, imagine my surprise when I found out that scrapping stories — that is, deciding part way through to not complete a project — is a very normal part of work at <a href='https://pudding.cool'>The Pudding</a>. In fact, my very first story here was scrapped and has never seen the light of day. And that's ok!"},{"type":"text","value":"I've been wanting to write about this for a while because I think it's important to normalize putting something down if it doesn't feel right any more. But knowing when to put something down and when to keep pushing forward with it is tricky. You don't want to give up on something great prematurely, but you also don't want to get stuck in the <a href='https://time.com/5347133/sunk-cost-fallacy-decisions/'>sunk cost fallacy</a>, pushing forward on something just because you've already put resources into it. So I decided to put our decision-making process into a flow chart."}],"intro2":[{"type":"text","value":"You may notice that there are a lot more paths that lead to \"SCRAP IT\" than there are that lead to \"PUBLISH IT\". That doesn't mean that we actually scrap more stories than we publish, just that there are several places where we stop and reflect on the story in its current stage and make a conscious decision whether we want to move forward with it, switch directions, or say goodbye."},{"type":"text","value":"Let's go through some examples of where our team has reached these junctures."}],"questions":[{"question":"Do you have a unique question & can it be answered with data?","key":"question","sectionIntro":["Since these first two junctures go hand-in-hand, I'll address them together. At The Pudding, we tend to start our process of creating a data story with a question. This helps us scope the story, not get buried under the size of it, and to make sure that we can move on to the next question: finding data to help us answer our particular question. Every once in a while, we move forward stories that didn't specifically start with a question (like our <a href='https://pudding.cool/2018/11/boy-bands'>Internet Boy Band Database</a>), but we make a conscious decision to move that forward, forgoing the question aspect.","Once you've got a question in mind, figure out if it's unique. Has someone asked and answered this question? If not, continue on. If they have, can you tell the story in a new or different way? For instance, a few years ago we wrote a story about <a href='https://pudding.cool/2017/09/clinics'>access to abortion clinics</a> throughout the US. This is a story that has been told before, but we wanted to tell the story using new data: driving times to abortion clinics. Because this was a new angle, we considered it a \"unique\" question and moved forward.","Next, our question needs to be able to be answered with data. In our story about the <a href='https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/'>ineffectiveness of women's pockets</a>, Jan and I could have started with a question like \"why are women's pockets so small?\". That technically is a question, but it is one that is harder to answer with data. Reframing the question to \"how much smaller are women's pockets than men's?\" or \"are women's jean pockets smaller than men's across the board?\" gives us a question that can be answered by data and allows us to move forward."],"examples":[{"exTitle":"Stories we’ve scrapped at this stage:","stories":["I've had \"fairytales?\" written in my backlog for 2 years now. Someday I'll come up with a good question to ask about fairytales…","Team speedruns, maybe add a bit of that story here?"]}]},{"question":"Do the data exist?","key":"exist","sectionIntro":["There are many sources of open, available data that exist on the internet. Things like <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/'>kaggle</a> and<a href='http://data.world/'> </a><a href='http://data.world/'>data.world</a> provide a wide variety of datasets. There are also things (US-based) like the <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/datastatistics/index.html'>CDC</a> or other government data for your country, state, or city. Sometimes, these sources work well and can effectively be used to answer the question we had (check out our use of CDC data in this story about <a href='https://pudding.cool/2018/07/birth_control'>birth control</a> or our use of Chicago prosecution data in a story about <a href='https://pudding.cool/2019/10/prosecutors'>Kim Foxx</a>).","But, sometimes pre-existing data sources don't help you answer your question. When you use data for a purpose other than the one it was collected for, you need to assess whether your use and interpretation of the data is accurate. Sometimes you can change your question to fit the data. But otherwise, in these cases where pre-exiting data won't work for you, you may be able to collect your own data. We create our own datasets frequently. Sometimes, we can create datasets from open sources like Wikipedia (check out several of <a href='https://pudding.cool/2018/08/wiki-death'>our</a> <a href='https://pudding.cool/2018/09/wiki-billboard'>stories</a> <a href='https://pudding.cool/2018/10/wiki-breakout'>that</a> <a href='https://pudding.cool/2019/05/people-map'>utilize</a> Wiki data) or <a href='https://pudding.cool/2020/05/travel-local'>TripAdvisor</a>.","Other times we need to manually collect the data ourselves. To find out how much smaller women's pockets are than men's, Jan and I physically went to stores to <a href='https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets'>measure pockets</a> and recorded our <a href='https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/pockets'>results</a>. To find the appearance of each <a href='https://pudding.cool/2018/11/boy-bands'>boyband member</a> in their band's music video, we enlisted the help of several volunteers to watch each music video and record <a href='https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/boybands'>specific details</a> about each person. Two other editorial assistants and I manually read through hundreds of high school <a href='https://pudding.cool/2019/02/dress-code-sexualization'>dress codes</a> to figure out which <a href='https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/dress_codes'>items were prohibited</a> in schools nationwide. Manually collecting data can be time consuming and the data may not pan out the way you expect, so be prepared to sink a lot of time here if you go this route."],"examples":[{"exTitle":"Stories we’ve scrapped at this stage:","stories":["Russell had pitched an idea about the use of bananas in cookbook recipes over time. Unfortunately, after lots of digging, we could only find either modern (within the last 10 years or so) or very old (pre-1900's) cookbooks that were digitized.

Which... is kinda interesting? We played with several questions here and <em>almost</em> scrapped the story before deciding to flip the question on its head and ask \"which books haven't been checked out in decades?\" Framing it as a reading list for people who want the books no one is reading gave it the spark that we were looking for.","One of our most engaging stories, a <a href='https://pudding.cool/2018/02/stand-up'>deep dive into Ali Wong's comedy routine</a>, was <em>almost</em> scrapped at this stage.

Generally it boils down to, \"is this your story to tell?\" This doesn't mean that you have to be an expert in every single thing you ever write about. But, it does mean that if your question is about something outside of your own lived experience and/or area(s) of expertise, you may not be asking the right question or have the right framing to tell this story. While it would have been better to involve an expert or someone with the lived experience you are describing earlier in the story-writing process, this point is absolutely the latest these things should be considered.

First, this was way too much to fit in one story without glossing over important details. Second, was that I (as a cis-gender, white woman) had life experience feeling sexualized at a young age by my school's dress code. But I couldn't speak to what it would be like to be a BIPOC or LGBTQIA student experiencing school dress codes as they are written.

At The Pudding, we often use storyboards to roughly sketch out how we want our story to go.

But when presented to the team, the idea felt flat. Wouldn't residents have already known about the weather before going there? Without a point of comparison, these numbers lose their interest. Instead, I decided to frame the same data around imagined post cards sent to Earth from the Curiosity rover on Mars. Curiosity could then explain the weather on Mars using the reader's location for a point of comparison. Even though the data and question remained the same, the pivot in story frame saved this story from being scrapped."]}]},{"question":"Make the thing; is it still interesting?","key":"make","sectionIntro":["This is our last checkpoint before a story gets published.

It piqued my curiosity enough that I collected data looking at descriptive tags used for over 100 titles on the platform and found that irreverent was the second most common tag used. A small story, certainly, but it was interesting and intriguing enough for me to move it forward. My problem was that I took too long to publish it. I sat on the story for various reasons, but by the time I felt ok publishing it in June, the story lost all of the things that made it interesting. People were still quarantining, but not as much, nor as vigilantly. Netflix had stopped promoting as many comedies and was promoting more \"heartfelt\" stories. Our stories don't typically rely on timeliness, but this one did and it missed its window. The data and story became stale and in the end, I decided to scrap it (and write this blog post instead)."]}]}]}
